### Creating patches

#### Setting up
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the `setup` gradle task   
   This will set up both `IC2-Base` and `IC2-Patched` projects, which contain clean and patched code respectively.  
   Note that while this code will compile, it's *highly unstable* and not suitable for playing.

#### Generating patches
After making changes to the code, run the `generatePatches` task of the `IC2-Patched` project to generate the patches.
This has to be done **manually** every time you make changes.

#### Building & Exporting
Run `gradlew build`to build the patcher. The resulting jar will be located in the `build/libs` folder. 
Remember that the jar build by the `jar` task **will NOT work** outside the dev environment.
