### Creating patches

#### Setting up
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `gradlew setupIC2`. 
   Aside of setting up the forge workspace, it will also download, decompile, and fix IC2, 
   which will then be decompiled into the IndustrialCraft2 subdirectory, where you can freely play around with the code.
   Note that while this code will compile and run, it's *highly unstable* and not suitable for playing.

#### Generating patches
After making changes to the code, run the `genIC2Patches` task to generate the patches.
This has to be done **manually** every time you make changes.

#### Building & Exporting
Run `gradlew build`to build the patcher. The resulting jar will be located in the `build/libs` folder. 
Remember that the jar build by the `jar` task (ran with `runClient` or `runServer`) **will NOT work** outside the dev environment.
